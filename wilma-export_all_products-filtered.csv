Enabled,NAS - file server/NAS box (samba + http interface),CA Technologies - AppLogic Appliances,"The NAS appliance is a shared file storage appliance. It provides file storage accessible over HTTP, NFS, and CIFS file protocols.
<br><br>
The NAS appliance serves files contained within a configured (pluggable) data volume thus providing the ability for the content served by the appliance to be changed easily as well as the ability for the volume to have varied sizes. For example, if NAS is being used to store log files, the data volume does not need to be as large as what may be needed to store content for an apache server.
<br><br>
The root directory of the volume is shared and the HTTP, NFS, and CIFS (samba) servers see the same volume, at the same root. The NFS server exposes the volume as a shared named /mnt/data. The CIFS server exposes the volume as a share named share. The root directory of the volume is accessible for read-only access by the HTTP server and for read-write access by the NFS and CIFS (samba) server.
<br><br>
The security for http access may be open (no user/pwd), fixed single user/pwd (from property) or from .htpasswd file stored within the root directory of the data volume.
<br><br>
The CIFS access is anonymous. It is assumed that only appliances that are allowed to access the volume are connected to the cifs terminal. This eliminates the need to configure complex security settings on the client and server and makes it possible to simply connect appliances that need file access to the cifs input.
<br><br>
There are three key use cases for the NAS appliance:
<br><br>
Serving large files over HTTP. The cifs interface is used to add/remove files (usually exported over a separate gateway)
<br><br>
As a shared file server through which other appliances/servers exchange files (fully internal to the application)
<br><br>
As a log server through which other appliances/servers store their log files so that those logs may be easily accessed/viewed by an administrator rather than having to log into each individual appliance.

Enabled,NASR - file server/NAS box with replication,CA Technologies - AppLogic Appliances,"The NASR appliance is a shared file storage appliance. It provides file storage accessible over HTTP, NFS, and CIFS file protocols as well as web interface for managing files. Additionally, two NASR appliances can be configured in a master-slave synchronization mode so that content on the master is replicated to the slave.
<br><br>
The NASR appliance serves files contained within a configured (pluggable) data volume thus providing the ability for the content served by the appliance to be changed easily as well as the ability for the volume to have varied sizes. For example, if NASR is being used to store log files, the data volume does not need to be as large as what may be needed to store content for an apache server.
<br><br>
The root directory of the volume is shared and the HTTP, NFS, and CIFS (samba) servers see the same volume, at the same root. The NFS server exposes the volume as a shared named /mnt/data. The CIFS server exposes the volume as a share named 'share'. The root directory of the volume is accessible for read-only access by the HTTP server and for read-write access by the NFS and CIFS (samba) server.
<br><br>
The CIFS access is anonymous. It is assumed that only appliances that are allowed to access the volume are connected to the cifs terminal. This eliminates the need to configure complex security settings on the client and server and makes it possible to simply connect appliances that need file access to the cifs input.
<br><br>
In its default configuration NASR serves as a regular NAS appliance. When configured, two NASR appliances can run in master-slave replication so that data on the master is kept replicated on the slave.
<br><br>
Replication is one way only, any changes on the slave are not replicated to the master. The replication is asynchronous and is triggered by file changes on the master's data volume. Data is replicated using rsync over its native protocol.
<br><br>
There are several key use cases for the NASR appliance:
<br><br>
Serving large files over HTTP. Files may be added through the file manager or via the cifs/nfs terminals.
<br><br>
As a shared file server through which other appliances/servers exchange files (fully internal to the application)
<br><br>
As a log server through which other appliances/servers store their log files so that those logs may be easily accessed/viewed by an administrator rather than having to log into each individual appliance.
<br><br>
As a replicated file storage (in any of the above cases) providing synchronized storage between two instances of an application (possibly running in different locations).

Enabled,HALB - Session-aware HTTP Load Balancer ,CA Technologies - AppLogic Appliances,"HALB is a switch for distributing workload to multiple Web servers of the same or different type. HALB is based on the HAProxy TCP/HTTP load balancing software package; which is designed to be extremely fast while consuming little resources.
<br><br>
HALB performs load-balancing functions using several algorithms. It performs simple round-robin balancing, equalizing the load for backend servers. It also supports persistent sessions, binding the client to a particular backend web server with session cookies or by using the request source ip address as a key. While using session cookies, any new sessions that do not have session cookies are distributed using the round-robin algorithm. HALB supports sessions with multiple cookies and modifies and/or tracks only the necessary ones, leaving others intact. Any particular session or client may be tied to particular backend web server or application using cookie association. Existing cookies may be transparently modified by HALB for clients that do not support requests with multiple cookies.
<br><br>
HALB constantly monitors the health state of all backend web servers. The health state checks conducted by HALB may include a simple TCP connect check or a more complex HTTP request (specified on HALB's boundary). In the case of a server failure detected by HALB using the parameterized health check method, HALB switches the traffic to an alternate server. If the failed server eventually recovers, HALB may switch the traffic back to the recovered server.
<br><br>
HALB exposes a web service interface on its ctl terminal. This interface allows a user to programmically enable/disable output terminals out1 - out8 and also to retrieve the state of all terminals. This is useful in cases when there is some kind of backend failure (i.e., such as in a database or storage appliance) where the application itself can automatically disable traffic to a specific set of servers. Note that in this case, HALB itself is unable to detect this type of failure; so it is up to the application to detect the failure and disable the corresponding set of backend servers.
<br><br>
HALB maintains detailed statistics including backend state, number of requests processed per server, number of errors occured, etc. The statistics are reported through the mon terminal and separate counters are also exposed through the ui terminal as a GUI accessible with a browser.
<br><br>
HALB is designed to be extremely fast using very few resources. Under regular conditions, HALB consumes about 25KB of memory for every session, or 1GB for 40000 simultaneous sessions, and processes up to 6000 requests per second.

TCP load balancing functionality is based on the HAProxy TCP/HTTP load balancing software package; UDP load balancing is based on Netfilter.
<br><br>
L3LB load-balances the incoming traffic using several different algorithms. For TCP traffic L3LB performs simple round-robin load-balancing, equalizing the load for the backend servers. For TCP L3LB also supports persistent sessions, binding the client to a particular backend server by using the request source IP address as a key. For UDP traffic, L3LB uses the round-robin algorithm (this is the only algorithm available for UDP traffic).
<br><br>
L3LB constantly monitors the health state of all backend servers. While in TCP mode, the health state checks conducted by L3LB consist of a simple TCP connect check. In the case of a server failure detected by L3LB using the parameterized health check method, L3LB switches the traffic to an alternate server. If the failed server eventually recovers, L3LB may switch the traffic back to the recovered server. For UDP mode an ICMP PING is used to verify availability of a backend server.

PS8 is parameterized to recognize specific protocols and ports for requests received on its in terminal. The recognized incoming traffic is forwarded through the specified output terminal based upon PS8's parameterization. Optionally, the forwarded traffic's port may be overidden by PS8. For example, PS8 can be used to forward all incoming TCP traffic on port 80 through the out5 output terminal on port 8080.

RPL sends any headers and documents received with the request to the outputs. RPL ignores the responses from the output requests, including possible failures to send the request. RPL always returns SUCCESS for recognized HTTP requests on its input, without waiting for any of the outputs to respond. For requests that require a document to be returned, RPL returns an empty document.
<br><br>
RPL is intended for distributing fire-and-forget asynchronous notifications. (Future versions of RPL may have additional parameterization that modifies its behavior, including aggregating the responses from outputs and returning them on the input).
<br><br>
RPL can tolerate, and indeed expects under normal circumstances, any of its outputs being unconnected or non-responsive. Appliances connected to RPL's outputs may be stopped, on standby or non-responsive, without this affecting the operation and performance of RPL.

URLSW is used in applications that have more then one web or application server appliances to flexibly distribute HTTP requests among them. URLSW operates similar to it's counterpart PS8, but on a higher level - it analyzes HTTP requests instead of tcp/udp ports.
<br><br>
URLSW also has an embedded heath checker. Health checker periodically polls connected out terminals and determines whether the servers are ready to process requests.

Enabled,INSSLR - Redundant HTTP Input Gateway with SSL Support,CA Technologies - AppLogic Appliances,"The INSSLR appliance is a layer-7 gateway for secure HTTP requests. It converts the requests to unencoded HTTP requests. This can be used whenever it is necessary to support secure HTTP on the client's side, but the back-end processing infrastructure does not or cannot support SSL, including:
<br><br>
using a fast and light-weight HTTP server that does not have SSL support
<br><br>
using multiple back-end servers, for performance or for redundancy, connected through a load-balancing switch
<br><br>
using multiple back-end servers for unrelated functions, connected through a URL switch
<br><br>
offloading the SSL encryption/decryption to a separate server to improve throughput
<br><br>
If configured, INSSLR also supports client certificate authentication. In the case of SSL mutual authentication, both the client and server exchange their certificates and corresponding public keys. The client may contact the certificate authority (CA) which issued the server's certificate and confirm the certificate is authentic before proceeding. The server may do likewise.
<br><br>
In its default configuration INSSLR acts as a layer-7 gateway for secure HTTP requests, also providing firewalled entry point for network traffic into an AppLogic application, which can be configured with an Internet-accessible static IP address.
<br><br>
When configured, two INSSLR appliances can be used in failover mode to provide a redundant service. In this case, INSSLR IP address (configured via ip_addr) is running on only one of the nodes and is automatically transferred to the other INSSLR appliance in case of failure. At any given moment, only one of the INSSLR appliance is active. When running in failover mode INSSLR can be configured to run in several modes:
<br><br>
asymmetric - one of the appliances is primary and whenever it is online it takes over the IP address and becomes active. The backup appliance becomes active only if the primary node fails (or is stopped). Whenever the primary appliance becomes available again, it takes over the IP address and becomes active. The primary appliance is the one with the lowest IP address (string comparison) as set in the fover_local_ip property.
<br><br>
symmetric - both appliances are primary and whichever appliance starts first takes over the IP address and becomes active. The other appliance becomes active only if the first appliance fails (or is stopped). Whenever the first appliance becomes available again, it does not automatically take over the IP address.
<br><br>
When running in redundant mode, INSSLR provides an interface on its ctl terminal for:
<br><br>
forcing INSSLR to become primary
<br><br>
forcing INSSLR to become backup
<br><br>
check the state of INSSLR (primary/backup)
<br><br>
INSSLR constantly monitors the health state of the backend appliance connected to its http terminal. The health state checks conducted by INSSLR may include a simple TCP connect check or a more complex HTTP request (specified on INSSLR's boundary). In the case of a failure of the connected appliance, INSSLR reports an error to the grid dashboard or, if in redundant mode and configured to do so, it does a failover to the backup INSSLR appliance.
<br><br>
To support applications that need to appear at a single IP address for more than one service, INSSLR can be configured to direct non-HTTP traffic transparently to a separate output terminal. For such connections, the appliance acts as a layer-3 firewall/NAT router.

Enabled,OUT - Single host output gateway with firewall (iptables),CA Technologies - AppLogic Appliances,"OUT is an output gateway that provides access to a network host located outside of an application. OUT accepts traffic from the application on its in terminal and forwards it through its external interface to the remote host.
<br><br>
OUT has a firewall that allows only outgoing traffic (connections and datagrams); it drops incoming traffic that is not for an already established connection or related to a datagram request.
<br><br>
OUT passes all traffic to the remote host specified by the remote_host property. The remote host can be specified either as a DNS host name (e.g., www.3tera.com) or as an IP address in ""dots"" notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1). If the remote host is configured using a DNS name, the OUT gateway will ensure that if the name-to-IP mapping changes, the gateway will redirect its traffic to the new IP address.
<br><br>
OUT is used to access services outside of the application, such as an external database, web service or document repository. OUT is the only appliance in an application that needs to be configured with the name or IP address of the remote host; the remaining application components can access that host simply by being connected to the OUT appliance input.

Enabled,VPN - Virtual Private Networking Appliance,CA Technologies - AppLogic Appliances,"VPN is a Virtual Private Networking appliance that operates in IPv4 and IPv6 networks, designed to provide secure and reliable tunnels for inter-grid communications as well as remote access to applications and appliances. VPN can also operate without using VPN tunnels, in which case it functions as a combined cleartext IN/OUT gateway. VPN may also be used to seamlessly interconnect IPv4 and IPv6 AppLogic grids. VPN is based on the OpenVPN, OpenSSH and Racoon open source software packages.
<br><br>
VPN has three basic modes of operation: server, client, and both.
When operating as a server, traffic received through the external interface is sent through the srv terminal. If VPN is using a tunnel, traffic from the tunnel established over the external interface is decrypted prior to being forrwarded through the srv terminal. In this mode of operation, VPN operates as a IN gateway with VPN tunnel support.
<br><br>
When operating as a client, traffic received through the clt terminal is sent forwarded through the external interface. If VPN is using a tunnel, traffic is encrypted prior to being sent through the tunnel established over the external interface. In this mode of operation, VPN operates as an OUT gateway with VPN tunnel support.
When operating as both a server and a client, both of the above traffic flows are supported providing for operation as a combined IN/OUT gateway.
<br><br>
VPN supports IPSec, shared secrets files, SSL certificates and ssh key files for authentication and encryption. A regular OpenVPN/OpenSSH client may be used on a remote workstation to connect to VPN, which in turn provides secure access to the internal components of an application running on AppLogic. The VPN appliance supports the generation of shared secrets files, SSL certificates and ssh keys.
<br><br>
In order to remotely access an AppLogic application over a secure VPN tunnel using VPN, the OpenVPN client-side software, or OpenSSH may be used on the client's machine (or some other compatible software).

Enabled,Cloud Workshop - Fast Track Analysis,The Armada Group T,"<p>Cloud architectures and technologies (public and private) have reached a tipping point in maturity that every enterprise needs to consider the value for implementation. The key questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What I should move & NOT move to the cloud? </li>
<li>How do I move to the cloud?</li>
<li>What should I do first?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Fast Track Workshop answers these questions and puts you on a path to actionable projects that deliver measurable business value. We combine customer’s knowledge of business, infrastructure and operation with experiences of Armada consultants, a knowledgebase of architecture patterns and vendor/provider solution profiles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Value Chain</strong></p>
<p>The resulting solutions are focused on delivering value because the Workshop follows a value-chain that links business drivers directly to a solution and execution framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Drivers</em></strong> - the pain points, needs, objectives and desired benefits for change that determine the highest priority needs of the organization. </p>
<p><strong><em>IT Impacts</em></strong> - The IT initiatives that need to occur and how are they prioritized.</p>
<p><strong><em>Capability</em></strong> - the knowledge, skills and resources the organization has to complete these initiatives</p>
<p><strong><em>Execution Framework</em></strong><strong> </strong>– comes from comparing prioritized initiatives and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis Framework</strong></p>
<p>Armada's ""Cloud Evaluation Framework (CEF)"" is a collection of tools and methods that defines all aspects of an architectural change. It gathers information designed to answer the detailed questions before deploying an application to a public cloud.  The CEF is also a critical input to the development of private cloud architecture.</p>
<p>The framework covers six major categories.</p>
<p><strong><em>Workload</em></strong></p>
<p>A profile of the usage & performance of the application over a period of time. It is a technical representation of the business demand/drivers for IT resources.</p>
<p><strong><em>Architecture</em></strong></p>
<p>A analysis of the design of the infrastructure and applications to determine to identify if you can technically take advantage of cloud architecture, and/or how much work would be needed to achieve the value.</p>
<p><strong><em>Financial</em></strong></p>
<p>The entire cost and benefit analysis for the application from current state to target end-state.  The financial model considers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial Investment</li>
<li>Operating costs</li>
<li>Opportunity cost </li>
<li>Cost avoidance</li>
<li>Cost of features you are getting from the new architecture (and paying for) that you do not need.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Risk</em></strong></p>
<p>The key areas you need to provision for in adopting the new architecture;</p>
<ul>
<li>Contractual</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Technical</li>
<li>Implementation</li>
<li>Resource</li>
<li>Organizational</li>
<li>External</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Operations </em></strong></p>
<p>What are the impacts on the people, process and tools used to deliver IT services. Some key areas include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment, Testing, Change Management</li>
<li>Capacity Management, Performance</li>
<li>Tools Integration, Automation</li>
<li>Availability, Business Continuity, Architecture</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Security </em></strong></p>
<p>The requirements of the application and the data it uses - the most closely scrutinized aspect of cloud today.</p>
<p>Primary topics include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Jurisdiction</li>
<li>Compliance/Certification (FISMA, DIACAP , HIPAA, HITECH or PCI to GLBA etc..)</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Regulation</li>
<li>Design/Architecture</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong></p>
<p>Each workshop is customized to meet deliver the maximum value to each customer’s business requirement. It is an intensive, interactive working session that leverages the knowledge of customer’s staff and consultant’s experience.</p>
<p>In additional to the value chain, a typical workshop includes topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the value of the Cloud?</li>
<li>Cloud Market Analysis </li>
<li>Common Architectural Patterns</li>
<li>How to Calculate ROI/Business Case</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Snapshot</strong></p>
<p>In preparation for each workshop an online conference is schedule to understand the customer’s environment. A customer can choose to participate in this call and receive a Snapshot Report at no cost. The Snapshot Report includes a brief analysis of how cloud architectures can deliver benefit for a customers specific business drivers.</p>"
